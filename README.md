# Movie_Sentiment_Analysis

A simple NLP based ML model, that predicts if a movie review is positive or negative.
I utilized the IMDB 50k reviews dataset, applied NLP pre-processing techniques such as tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming, and TF-IDF to transform words into numerical matrices, and fed the processed data into machine learning models like Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression to make predictions on whether a review is positive or negative.
